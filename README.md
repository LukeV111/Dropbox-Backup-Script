# Dropbox-Backup-Script
Python code to back up any folder on your PC to dropbox at a time inteval of your choice, without accessing the Dropbox API (or even needing to be able to connect to the internet).

Simply edit the path to your source file as well as your destination file, change the time and then you're good to run the script while you work.
